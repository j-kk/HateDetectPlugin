HateDetect checks your comments using the codeagainsthate service to see if they contain hate speech or not.

== Description ==

HateDetect checks your comments using the [codeagainsthate](codeagainsthate.eu) service to see if they contain hate speech or not.
Provides easy access to see which comments contain hate and lets you automatize comments approval or rejection after
hate detection.
In case when comment contains hate, it provides an explanation, why comment was marked.
The explanation may be shown to the user after submitting the comment (administrator can decide).

us to obtain an access code. It's required to use the plugin.
